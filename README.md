# **45 Days of Vue – Daily UI Coding Challenge**

This repository documents my **45 Days of Vue Challenge**, where I build one Vue project every day based on modern UI designs (mostly from Dribbble).
The goal is to level up my frontend skills, become faster at reproducing UI layouts, and build a strong collection of Vue-based projects.

---

## 🚀 **Challenge Goals**

* Improve my Vue 3 frontend development skills
* Practice converting UI designs into functional components
* Strengthen Tailwind CSS knowledge
* Build visual, clean, and reusable Vue components
* Produce 45 small-to-medium UI projects for my portfolio
* Stay consistent for 45 days straight

---

## 🧰 **Tech Stack**

* **Vue 3** (Composition API)
* **Vite**
* **Tailwind CSS**
* **PrimeVue / PrimeIcons** (when needed)
* **Pinia** (only for projects that require state)
* **TypeScript** (optional, per project)

## 📅 **Daily Progress**

I will update this section as I complete each project.

| Day | Project Name  | Folder | Live Demo |
| --- | ------------- | ------ | --------- |
|     | *To be added* | –      | –         |

## 🗂 **Repository Structure**

This repo will follow a consistent structure:

Each project will be an independent Vue + Vite setup with its own documentation and screenshot.

Each project folder will include:
