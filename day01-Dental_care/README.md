DentalCare – Dentist Landing Page (Vue 3)

A simple and responsive dentist landing page built with Vue 3, Vite, and CSS.
Inspired by the Dribbble shot "BrightSmile — Dentist Landing Page" (https://dribbble.com/shots/25897689-BrightSmile-Dentist-Landing-Page). This is a custom implementation and reimagining of that layout — colors, spacing, and components were adapted and rebuilt specifically for DentalCare using Vue 3, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
